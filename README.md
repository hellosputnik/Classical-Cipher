# Classical Cipher

Classical Cipher is a tool that performs cryptanalysis for classical ciphers (e.g. Rail fence cipher, Caesar cipher, Vigen√®re cipher). Frequency analysis, correlation of frequency, and index of coincidence are employed in the deduction of the cipher, key/key length, and plaintext.
